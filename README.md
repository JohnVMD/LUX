"Liquid User Experience" is a simple portfolio style web app, no Tailwind, no shadcn, no ~~AI~~Copilot or Cursor (I did start making GPT questions on how to better build file structure for the project :P). The main objective is to grow my understanding of CSS and the Angular framework, without cheeky shortcuts.
