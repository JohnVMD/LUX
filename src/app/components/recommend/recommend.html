    <h2>Tech I enjoy:</h2>
    <p><em>Software</em> - Omarchy</p>
    <p>Of all OS I have tested, Omarchy has been the most impressive. Built up from Arch linux, 
    the ricing makes it accessible even for new linux users (like me!). <br> Omarchy makes for customizable a flexible and stable OS.

    <br>
    <p><em>Software</em> - Samsung DEX</p>
    <p>Samsung Galaxy S devices have the ability to simulate a desktop environment with Android. <br>
    Combined with an app like RustDesk (open-source), you can remote access a Windows or Linux PC and use it from your phone or tablet, 
    thus essencialy having a full x86 architecture on the go with easy access to android apps without the trouble of emulation.

    <p><em>Hardware</em> - Womier WK61</p>
    <p>A decent budget mechanical keyboard in the 60% format that is very reliable. North facing LEDs with unfortunate no VIA support, 
    cherry red linear switches (pre-lubed btw).
