<h2>Tech I enjoy:</h2>
<p><em>Software</em> - Omarchy</p>
<p>Of all OS I have tested, Omarchy has been the most impressive. Built up from Arch linux, 
    the ricing makes it accessible even for new linux users (like me!). <br> Omarchy takes the ease of use from win10
    and the endless possibilities that Arch offers, combining a bunch of great tools into a flexible and stable OS.

<p>Samsung Galaxy S devices have the ability to simulate a desktop environment within Android</p>
